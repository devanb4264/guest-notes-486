#Part 1

Made a UNA faculty knowledge base with all CRUD ops

Can deploy in-house infrastructure at home using dynamic DNS
Static IP - IP assigned to your company permanently while contract lasts
No-ip(website) - used for dynamic IP
Dynamic IP changes on an interval
Reverse proxy self domain - subdomain networking thing (tbc)
Companies try to deploy their backend externally to a trusted third party
Hackers target backend rather than frontend, since more data is present
Bad weather is bad for hosting in-house servers

External infrastructure using cloud
Use cloudry - $1.50 a month, enough cloud infrastructure to host an app. Returns a static, public IP
Puts liability onto the host company instead
Learn about system

#Part 2

Reverse proxy self domain - reverse proxy server using a custom domain to manage and route requests to different backend services or servers. Combination of reverse proxy and self-domain

Reverse proxy - intermediary that receives client requests, forwards them to the appropriate server, and then sends the server's response back to the client.

Self-domain - using a domain that you own.
	
A reverse proxy can help with load balancing, security, and caching. (It helps hide the identity and structure of backend services.)

It can benefit my full-stack app by having a unified access point to route all my traffic through a single domain, while utilizing subdomains for the different parts of my app if needed. It can also be used to hide the architecture of my backend code, (if the majority of it wasn’t posted on github).

#Part 3

Could you tell us a little more about the reverse proxy self domain, or hw your app benefits from it/utilizes it? You began the topic last session but I don’t think we ever got any more detail on it.

What are the differences or benefits of using a static IP versus a dynamic IP for an infrastructure in regards to accessibility and security? (specifically in the case of Quan's app / why he would use one over the other.)
